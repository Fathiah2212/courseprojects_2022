# To ask for the IP address that is bound to eth0 interface, I can use the netifaces module.

# Then, storing the command in a variable so that it will be easy for me to print it out in an intended message below.
# [ni.AF_INET] sockets are IP addresses and port numbers, by calling this out I can print IP address, netmask, broadcast.
